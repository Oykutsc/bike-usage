# Analysing and guessing bike usage in Databricks
Rental bike usage is getting more and more common. I tried using Databricks to do an analysis and guessing on rental bike usage data. I did the data analysis in Python and machine learning in R on the same notebook. The data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/rental-bike-sharing). This notebook answers these questions and uses multiple models for machine learning.
1. How does the bike usage change over the two years?
2. How does the bike usage change in a work or nonwork day?
3. What is the effect of seasons and weather situations on bike usage?
4. How do registered and casual users act in a day?
